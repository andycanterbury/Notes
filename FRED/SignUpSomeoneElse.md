#Sign Up Someone Else
***
##Family Select Tool:
- How do we connect the FST (or otherwise indicate it should be used) to a form? 
- If we build this in front of the form, FRED needs to accept a contact ID and verify that they are in your household. 
- Is Form Submission the logged in person or the person being signed up?

##Non-Family
- How do we indicate a form allows you to sign up others? 
- Create Contact if it doesn't match an existing one?
    - What if it ***does*** exist?
    - Is it safe to assume that's who they wanted?
- Or just save as Form Response Submissions?
- Is Form Submission the logged in person or the person being signed up?
