#Sprint 93 Demo Notes 10/29/2018
----
## Learnings
##### Refresh tokens
Tokens were expiring and causing all kinds of issues for form makers and form filler outers. 
- Started by copying from `crds-signin-checkin`
    - That wasn't saving the updated token because .net core
    - Would have required wrapping each/every controller method in an Authorized method
- Middleware to the rescue!
    - Allowed us to write one method that happens before any request gets to any controller
    - No changes to controllers
##### Email From/Reply To
Confirmation emails were being sent using a From and Reply to of Contact ID #1 which is the Think Ministry contact. Some users replied to their confirmation emails and were automatically generated a help desk ticket from Think Ministry

Web.Common, which we use to send emails, doesn't use the email addresses in the template, you must provide one. 
- Overrode `MPEmailSender.SendEmail()` method to add a `useTemplateAddresses` flag which uses the From and Reply To email addresses from the template instead of any passed in.
